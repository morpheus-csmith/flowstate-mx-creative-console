## 💡 The Big Idea

> Your MX Creative Console automatically knows if you're color grading vs. cutting in Premiere, or writing vs. debugging in VS Code — and reconfigures itself in real-time. No manual profile switching. Just flow.

---

## 🎯 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎯 Context Detection** | Detects *what you're doing* within each app, not just which app is open |
| **🔮 Predictive Mapping** | Learns your workflow and anticipates what you'll need next |
| **🎤 Voice Control** | Say "switch to color" and your console reconfigures instantly |
| **⚡ Cross-App Macros** | Chain actions across multiple apps with one button |

---

## 🖥️ Supported Applications

| App | Contexts |
|-----|----------|
| Premiere Pro | Editing, Color Grading |
| VS Code | Writing, Debugging |
| Blender | Modeling, Sculpting |
| Photoshop | Retouching, Compositing |
| Figma | UI Design, Prototyping |
| After Effects | Animation, VFX |

## 🚀 Try It Out

### [▶️ Live Demo](https://morpheus-csmith.github.io/flowstate-mx-creative-console/)

Interactive prototype — switch apps, change tasks, click buttons, run macros, use voice commands. Everything works!

**How to use:**
1. **Select an app** from the right panel (Premiere, VS Code, Blender, etc.)
2. **Choose a task** (Editing, Color Grading, Debugging, etc.)
3. **Watch the console reconfigure** automatically
4. **Click buttons** on the MX Console or Actions Ring
5. **Try the macro** — click "Run Macro" to see cross-app automation
6. **Test voice** — click and hold the voice button

## 🎬 Video Pitch Script (60 seconds)

**[0:00-0:08] HOOK**
> "What if your MX Creative Console could read your mind? Not literally — but close. Watch what happens when I switch from editing to color grading."

**[0:08-0:20] THE PROBLEM**
> "Current plugins are static. One profile per app. But creative work isn't static — you're constantly switching between editing, color grading, audio mixing, effects. Each switch breaks your flow."

**[0:20-0:35] THE SOLUTION**
> "FlowState uses AI to detect what you're actually doing — not just which app is open. Open the Lumetri panel? Boom — exposure, contrast, and color wheels appear. Start debugging code? Your console becomes a debugger control surface."

**[0:35-0:48] KEY FEATURES**
> "It learns your patterns and predicts what you'll need next. Voice commands let you switch modes hands-free. And cross-app macros chain actions across multiple applications with one button."

**[0:48-0:60] CLOSE**
> "FlowState: context-aware control that adapts to you. Built for the MX Creative Console. Built for how creatives actually work."
